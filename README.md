This is a very hands-on learning by doing the course. The author provides all assets which you can download via the course resources section. 
INCLUDED ASSETS : 
Duck model
Audio sound files
Environmental assets via a download
Gun model
Graphics for the on-screen display
The author starts with the absolute basics, how to setup Unity and Vuforia, how to import 3D models into unity and then make it all come together. As we progress I explain how to use the Vuforia image targets how to build games in Unity 3D. What better way to learn to code for augmented reality than creating an addictive classic game?
